# Deploy and Host bin-api on Railway

bin-api is a minimalist HTTP API for testing and debugging HTTP requests during development. This "bin" API receives arbitrary HTTP requests and returns all request details as structured JSON responses, making it perfect for webhook testing, API debugging, and integration testing.

## About Hosting bin-api

Hosting bin-api involves deploying a lightweight Go-based HTTP server that processes incoming requests and returns structured JSON responses. The application is stateless, requires no database, and runs in a single container with minimal resource requirements. Railway's platform handles the containerization, scaling, and networking automatically, making deployment as simple as connecting your GitHub repository. The service exposes port 8081 and includes built-in health checks for reliable operation in production environments.

## Common Use Cases

- **Webhook Testing**: Test webhook integrations from GitHub, Stripe, or other services without setting up real endpoints
- **API Development**: Debug HTTP requests during microservices development and validate request/response formats
- **CI/CD Pipeline Testing**: Use as a mock endpoint in automated testing pipelines to validate deployment scripts and API integrations

## Dependencies for bin-api Hosting

- **Go Runtime**: Go 1.24.3 or later for building the application binary
- **Container Runtime**: Docker-compatible environment for containerized deployment

### Deployment Dependencies

- [Railway CLI](https://docs.railway.app/develop/cli) - Command-line interface for Railway deployments
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) - Container runtime for local testing and Railway's build process
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/secnex/bin-api) - Source code repository for Railway integration
- [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/) - Web interface for deployment management and monitoring

### Implementation Details

Railway deployment can be configured using a `railway.toml` file or through environment variables:

```toml
[build]
builder = "dockerfile"

[deploy]
healthcheckPath = "/healthz"
healthcheckTimeout = 30
restartPolicyType = "on_failure"

[env]
PORT = "8081"
```

For manual deployment via Railway CLI:

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Deploy from repository
railway up

# Set custom domain (optional)
railway domain add your-bin-api.railway.app
```

The Dockerfile is already optimized for Railway's build system with multi-stage builds and minimal Alpine Linux base image.

## Why Deploy bin-api on Railway?

Railway is a singular platform to deploy your infrastructure stack. Railway will host your infrastructure so you don't have to deal with configuration, while allowing you to vertically and horizontally scale it.

By deploying bin-api on Railway, you are one step closer to supporting a complete full-stack application with minimal burden. Host your servers, databases, AI agents, and more on Railway.

### Additional Railway Benefits for bin-api

- **Zero-Config Deployment**: Railway automatically detects the Dockerfile and builds your bin-api without additional configuration
- **Built-in Monitoring**: Railway provides real-time logs, metrics, and health monitoring for your bin-api instance
- **Automatic HTTPS**: Railway provides SSL certificates and HTTPS endpoints out of the box for secure API testing
- **Environment Management**: Easy management of development, staging, and production environments for your testing infrastructure
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay-per-use pricing model perfect for development tools that don't require constant uptime
